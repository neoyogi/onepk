Routing Service Set Tutorial
--------------------------

This is the onePK Routing Service Set Tutorial in which the C Routing API is
demonstrated. The following program will first, establish a session with the
connecting Network Element (see Session Element Tutorial). Next, this program
will read the routes from the present RIB and display them to the user. Next,
this program will add and delete custom application routes to the Network
Element. The program will then add a listener so that it can receive up/down
route notifications in the RIB. Finally, this program will cleanup and
disconnect from the Network Element.

To run these tutorial:

Notes: Make sure that the onep Python module is installed
       Python version supported is 2.7.
              
   Usage:

   <TUTORIAL_NAME>.py -a <element hostname or address> \
         [-t <transport_type>] \
	     [-C <client cert file> -K <client private key file> \
	     -R <root certificates file>] \
	     [-P <tls pinning file>]

    -a <element hostname or address> Network element's hostname or IP address.
    -t <transport type> Transport type (tls|tipc).  Default is TLS.
    -C <client cert file> Client certificate file required TLS client
                          authentication.
    -K <client private key file> Client private key file required for TLS
                                 client authentication.
    -R <CA certs file> CA certificates file required for TLS.

    The application will prompt the user to enter username and password that 
    are configured on the network element you are connecting to.

    For more information on how to use TLS connection please refer to the 
     Getting Started Guide.
