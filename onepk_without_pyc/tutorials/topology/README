Topology Tutorial
--------------------------------------

The Topology Discovery Tutorial shows how to get the Network Element's
topology graph and neighbor neighbor network element information.
This tutorial will also show how to register a CDP listener and
handle the even when there's a topology change in the neighbors
of a Network Element.

To run this tutorial:

Notes: Make sure that the onep Python module is installed
       Python version supported is 2.7.
      
       For NX-OS platforms only: To configure the network element to run an Events tutorial, you must 
       first enable the EVMED feature, which allows developers to use Embedded Event Manager (EEM) to 
       monitor Application-, CLI-, and Interface Statistics-based events and then schedule actions on the 
       occurrence of those events:

       router(config)# feature evmed
       router(config)# sh feature |i evmed
       evmed   enabled
       
       
   Usage:

   TopologyTutorial.py -a <element hostname or address> \
         [-t <transport_type>] \
	     [-C <client cert file> -K <client private key file> \
	     -R <root certificates file>]

    -a <element hostname or address> Network element's hostname or IP address.
    -t <transport type> Transport type (tls|tipc).  Default is TLS.
    -C <client cert file> Client certificate file required TLS client
                          authentication.
    -K <client private key file> Client private key file required for TLS
                                 client authentication.
    -R <CA certs file> CA certificates file required for TLS.

    The application will prompt the user to enter username and password that 
    are configured on the network element you are connecting to.

    For more information on how to use TLS connection please refer to the 
     Getting Started Guide.
