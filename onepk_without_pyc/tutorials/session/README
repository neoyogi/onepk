Session Tutorial
----------------

This tutorial is intended for application developers who wish to have more
fine-grained control over the connections made between onePK applications
and network elements.

In onePK, a session represents an authenticated channel of communication
between an application and a network element. This tutorial will demonstrate
how to configure a session, how to get the properties and statistics of a
session, and how to reconnect to a disconnected session.

To run this tutorial:

Notes: Make sure that the onep Python module is installed
       Python version supported is 2.7.
              
   Usage:

   SessionTutorial.py -a <element hostname or address> \
         [-t <transport_type>] \
	     [-C <client cert file> -K <client private key file> \
	     -R <root certificates file>] \
	     [-P <tls pinning file>]

    -a <element hostname or address> Network element's hostname or IP address.
    -t <transport type> Transport type (tls|tipc).  Default is TLS.
    -C <client cert file> Client certificate file required TLS client
                          authentication.
    -K <client private key file> Client private key file required for TLS
                                 client authentication.
    -R <CA certs file> CA certificates file required for TLS.
    
    -P <tls pinning file> option is to provide the location of the pinning file where
    the certificate of remote host can be stored after manual 
    verification by user in case of TLS verification failure .
    To manually verify the certificate, use below command:
    on IOS: "sh crypto pki certificates verbose"
    on NXOS: "sh crypto ca certificates"
    
    The application will prompt the user to enter username and password that 
    are configured on the network element you are connecting to.

    For more information on how to use TLS connection please refer to the 
     Getting Started Guide.
