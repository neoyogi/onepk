Element Tutorial
--------------------------

The Element Service Set is the core device model for the onePK system. The network element
represents the hardware that hosts the network operating system and that provides network services
to onePK applications. The application connects to the network element and this connection
(session) is managed by the Element Service Set. Once the application has been authenticated
and authorized, it can access the network element information and other service sets.
Network Element information that the Element Service Set provides includes:

* Network element attributes such as address or license status
* Systems attributes such as memory and CPU usage

To run these tutorial:

Notes: Make sure that the onep Python module is installed
       Python version supported is 2.7.
              
   Usage:

   <TUTORIAL_NAME>.py -a <element hostname or address> \
         [-t <transport_type>] \
	     [-C <client cert file> -K <client private key file> \
	     -R <root certificates file>] \
	     [-P <tls pinning file>]

    -a <element hostname or address> Network element's hostname or IP address.
    -t <transport type> Transport type (tls|tipc).  Default is TLS.
    -C <client cert file> Client certificate file required TLS client
                          authentication.
    -K <client private key file> Client private key file required for TLS
                                 client authentication.
    -R <CA certs file> CA certificates file required for TLS.

    The application will prompt the user to enter username and password that 
    are configured on the network element you are connecting to.

    For more information on how to use TLS connection please refer to the 
     Getting Started Guide.
