Discovering onePK Services Tutorial
--------------------------

The Discovery tutorial was created to show how applications can connect
to a network element, and query for the list of services that network
element has available.  Information returned will be related to the base
and all optional service sets.  Detailed information such as version 
information are also returned.

To run this tutorial:

Notes: Make sure that the onep Python module is installed
       Python version supported is 2.7.
              
   Usage:

   DiscoveringOnePKServiceSetsTutorial.py -a <element hostname or address> \
         [-t <transport_type>] \
	     [-C <client cert file> -K <client private key file> \
	     -R <root certificates file>] \
	     [-P <tls pinning file>]

    -a <element hostname or address> Network element's hostname or IP address.
    -t <transport type> Transport type (tls|tipc).  Default is TLS.
    -C <client cert file> Client certificate file required TLS client
                          authentication.
    -K <client private key file> Client private key file required for TLS
                                 client authentication.
    -R <CA certs file> CA certificates file required for TLS.

    The application will prompt the user to enter username and password that 
    are configured on the network element you are connecting to.

    For more information on how to use TLS connection please refer to the 
     Getting Started Guide.
