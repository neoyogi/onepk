Location Tutorial
--------------------------

The Location tutorial was created to demonstrate the use of the Location
service set. The tutorial will connect to the network element.
Then it will set the geo, civic and custom locations of the network element
and an interface. The tutorial also, adds the location change listener,
creates location change event and handles it.
Finally, it will remove the listener and disconnect from the network element.
