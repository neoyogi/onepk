--------------------------

This is the onePK VTY Service Set Tutorial in which the Java VTY API is
demonstrated. The following program will first, establish a session with the

enabled on the device to run this tutorial.

Finally, this program will cleanup and disconnect from the Network Element.

To run this tutorial:

Notes: Make sure that the onep Python module is installed
       Python version supported is 2.7.
   
       To configure the network element to run the VTY tutorial, you must first enable the VTY Service Set:
       router(config)# onep
       router(config-onep)# service set vty

       This application is not fully supported on IOS-XR.
       
    Usage:
    
    VTYTutorial.py -a <element hostname or address> \
         [-t <transport_type>] \
    	 [-C <client cert file> -K <client private key file> \
    	 -R <root certificates file>]
     
    -a <element hostname or address> Network element's hostname or IP address.
    -t <transport type> Transport type (tls|tipc).  Default is TLS.
    -C <client cert file> Client certificate file required TLS client
                          authentication.
    -K <client private key file> Client private key file required for TLS
                                 client authentication.
    -R <CA certs file> CA certificates file required for TLS.
