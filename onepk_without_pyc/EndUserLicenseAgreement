2.5 U.S Government End Users. The SDK and Documentation are "commercial items" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software " and "commercial computer software documentation" as such items are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize Licensee to use Cisco's trademarks or trade names in Licensee's advertising, marketing, promotional, sales or related materials.

As between Cisco and Licensee, Cisco or its licensors shall own and retain all proprietary rights, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights, in and to the SDK, and Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, conveys and assigns to Cisco all of its right, title, and interest therein. Cisco shall have the exclusive right to apply for or register any patents, mask work rights, copyrights, and such other proprietary protections with respect thereto.

Subject to Ciscos ownership of the SDK, Licensee retains all right, title, and interest in the Licensee Applications, and except to the extent the SDK is included therein, Cisco shall have no ownership interest therein.

4.0 UPDATES; NO SUPPORT.  Cisco may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the SDK at any time without notice, but Cisco shall not be obligated to provide any Updates.  If Updates are made available, the terms of this Agreement will govern such Updates, unless the Update is accompanied by a new or supplemental license in which case the terms of that license will govern.  If an Update is made available, (i) it may have APIs, features, services, or functionality that are different from those found in the SDK licensed hereunder, (ii) it may not be backward compatible, and (iii) it may be incompatible with Licensee Applications developed, extended or enhanced using previous releases or versions of the SDK.  
Except as expressly provided in a legally binding support services agreement or amendment, Cisco is not obligated to provide Licensee with any support or technical assistance for the SDK or any Licensee Application. If Licensee desires support services for the SDK, and, provided Cisco offers such support services (in its sole discretion), Licensee must enter into a developer support agreement with Cisco.  For the avoidance of doubt, any support provided by Cisco will be limited to the SDK only and does not include Licensee Applications or any third party technology, including but not limited to software programs, applications, or APIs, unless specifically provided for in a separate written support agreement with, and provided by, Cisco.  LICENSEE EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT USE OF ANY LICENSEE APPLICATION MAY INTRODUCE NETWORK ISSUES OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO CISCO PRODUCTS USED BY LICENSEE, AND THAT ANY SUCH ISSUES OR PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO LICENSEE APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY ARE NOT COVERED UNDER CISCOS STANDARD SUPPORT OFFERINGS FOR ITS PRODUCTS, AND CISCO IS NOT LIABLE FOR, OR OBLIGATED TO RESOLVE, ANY SUCH ISSUES OR PROBLEMS.
Cisco has the right to unilaterally abandon further development of the SDK at any time and without any notice or liability to Licensee or any third party.

5.0 CONFIDENTIALITY.
5.1 The SDK and other Cisco technical information obtained by Licensee (collectively the "Confidential Information"), whether in whole or in part, are the confidential and proprietary information of Cisco.  Licensee will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except Licensee may disclose the Confidential Information to third parties only at a Cisco Developer Network Support Forum and only to the extent reasonably necessary to receive technical assistance in using the SDK.  Licensee shall at all times, both during the term of this Agreement and for a period of at least five (5) years after its termination, keep in trust and confidence all such Confidential Information, shall not use such Confidential Information other than as expressly authorized by Cisco under this Agreement, and shall not disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties without Cisco's prior written consent.  Licensee further agrees to immediately return to Cisco all Confidential Information (including copies thereof) in Licensee's possession, custody, or control upon termination of this Agreement at any time and for any reason.  The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information which (a) has entered the public domain except where such entry is the result of Licensee's breach of this Agreement; (b) prior to disclosure hereunder was already rightfully in Licensee's possession; (c) subsequent to disclosure hereunder is obtained by Licensee on a non-confidential basis from a third party who has the right to disclose such information to the Licensee; or (d) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a court order, so long as Cisco is given adequate notice and the ability to challenge such required disclosure.??
5.2 Licensee shall not disclose, advertise, or publish the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Cisco. Any press release or publication regarding this Agreement is subject to prior review and written approval of Cisco, which may be withheld at Ciscos discretion.  

6.0 FEEDBACK.  Licensee is not obligated to provide Cisco with comments or suggestions regarding the SDK.  However, should Licensee provide Cisco with comments or suggestions for the modification, correction, improvement or enhancement of the SDK, then Licensee hereby grants to Cisco a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license, including the right to sublicense to Cisco licensees and customers, under Licensees intellectual property rights, the rights to use and disclose such comments and suggestions in any manner Cisco chooses and to display, copy, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, and otherwise dispose of Ciscos products and/or services embodying such comments or suggestions in any manner and via any media Cisco chooses, but without reference to the source of such comments and/or suggestions.  

7.0 NO WARRANTY.  The SDK is provided "AS-IS" without any warranty whatsoever.

CISCO SPECIFICALLY AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR, OR OBLIGATION TO RESOLVE, ANY NETWORK ISSUES OR PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO LICENSEE APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY.

8.0 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WAIVER.  CISCO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE SDK, OR FOR THE LOSS OF DATA, INFORMATION OF ANY KIND, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL LOSS, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND WHETHER OR NOT CISCO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
